# Restaurant-Review-Sentiment-Analysis-Application

 This Python project is a command-line application that utilizes the Yelp API to analyze user opinions on specific restaurants. Users can enter a restaurant name, and the application will fetch relevant Yelp reviews, preprocess the text, and perform sentiment analysis using the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) algorithm from the NLTK library. The application will output the overall sentiment score and a breakdown of positive, negative, and neutral sentiment.
